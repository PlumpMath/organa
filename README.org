* Look, ma, no parser!

This project records my experiments with publishing static sites using
Org Mode.  See https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg for a previous example.

In the past I've written a few Org Mode parsers, but HTML is far
easier to parse in Clojure using Hiccup or Enlive.  The current code
relies on exporting to HTML first, parsing that, and modifying the
parse tree as needed.

Do not use this yet.
