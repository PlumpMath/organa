* Look, ma, no parser[fn::at least, no incomplete, hand-rolled, regex-based parser of the highly irregular Org Mode "grammar"...]!

This project records my recent experiments with publishing static
sites using Org Mode.  See https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg for a
previous example.

In the past I've written a few Org Mode parsers, but HTML is far
easier to parse in Clojure using Hiccup or Enlive.  The current code
relies on exporting to HTML first, parsing that, and modifying the
parse tree as needed.

Do not use this yet.  But, for the curious, my current workflow is:

1. uncomment the final form in the =organa.core= namespace,
   =src/organa/core.clj=
2. make edits to Org files in the source directory =local-site-dir=
3. export these using =\C-c e hh=
4. reevaluate the =organa.core= namespace, causing the site to be generated and
   synced to a Digital Ocean instance.
5. Go to 2.
